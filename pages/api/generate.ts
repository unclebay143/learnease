  [TASK: Let your reply be in ${replyLanguage}]
  Let your response be in markdown
  [TASK: I want to learn a new concept ${conceptToLearn}, my level is like a ${level}, I want you to explain to me like a ${level} in this format:
  [Guide: you can use emojis to make it more reader friendly and paraphrase the ## headings if needed]

  [INSTRUCTION: Always use the ## heading arrangements and wordings in the template and add markdown horizontal line after each headings]

  [INSTRUCTION: EMOJI should always be rendered in all languages]

  [INSTRUCTION: Always indicate the programming language of each code block in the markdown code block syntax]

  ## Definition EMOJI
  [paragraph] - [INSTRUCTION: break to new line after 2 dots.]
  [INSTRUCTION: Only if ${conceptToLearn} is code related generate at least one sample of ${conceptToLearn} in markdown code block]
  [INSTRUCTION: Do not put code block heading, text, list, paragraphs or sentence inside the markdown code block backticks, only code syntax and its comments should be within code blocks, you've made this mistakes before]
  [INSTRUCTION: Don't repeat the question asked in your response]
 

  ## Analogy EMOJI
  [paragraph]

  ## Practical use case in real-world EMOJI
  [paragraph]
  [bullet points]

  ## Friendly projects to build with the concept EMOJI
  [INSTRUCTION: The projects must be for ${level} level]
  [paragraph]
  [bullet points]
  [Only If the concept is code related, then provide a simple code from the projects bullet points]

  ## What to learn next? EMOJI
  [paragraph]
  [bullet points]

  ## Wrapping Up? EMOJI
  [paragraph]
  [INSTRUCTION: generate links from most viewed resource on ${conceptToLearn} from youtube, articles etc]
